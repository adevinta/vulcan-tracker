    "cwe_id": 358,
    "description": "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Implement a well-formed and correct CSP policy for this site.",
      "The policy should not contain unsafe directive for anything but style.",
      "The policy should not allow to load content from an insecure scheme (only https)."
